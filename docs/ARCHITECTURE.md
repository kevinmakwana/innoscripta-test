# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Laravel backend scaffold architecture, designed for fetching, normalizing, and deduplicating articles from external sources.

## System Components

```
[External Sources] --> [Adapters] --> [Jobs] --> [Normalization] --> [Deduplication] --> [Persistence] --> [API]
                          |            |            |                  |                  |
                          v            v            v                  v                  v
                    [SourceAdapterInterface] [FetchSourceJob] [ArticleNormalizationService] [DeduplicationService] [Models/Controllers]
```

### Data Flow

1. **External Sources**: RSS feeds, APIs, etc., providing raw article data.
2. **Adapters**: Implement `SourceAdapterInterface` to fetch and parse data from specific sources (e.g., NewsAPI, RSS).
3. **Jobs**: `FetchSourceJob` processes each source asynchronously, handling concurrency and failures.
4. **Normalization**: `ArticleNormalizationService` standardizes data into `NormalizedArticle` DTOs.
5. **Deduplication**: `DeduplicationService` merges duplicates and ensures uniqueness.
6. **Persistence**: Saves to database models (Article, Author, Category, Source).
7. **API**: RESTful endpoints via controllers, returning resources with pagination.

## Key Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Services and adapters injected via constructors.
- **Event-Driven**: Listeners for failures (e.g., `SourceFetchFailed`).
- **Queue-Based**: Jobs for async processing, with Redis/RabbitMQ support.
- **Contracts**: Interfaces for adapters and brokers ensure pluggability.

## Scaling Considerations

- **Workers**: Increase queue workers for higher throughput.
- **Batching**: Group jobs for efficiency.
- **Rate Limits**: Implement in adapters to avoid API throttling.
- **Resilience**: Retry policies and failure thresholds.
